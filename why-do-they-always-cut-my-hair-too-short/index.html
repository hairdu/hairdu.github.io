<p>As a professional hairdresser here are my two cents and a little ranting mixed in First of all to everyone who seems to be flabbergasted about how often she highlights her hair who are you. Hairdressers dont actually hate long hair it is just a lot harder to maintain and most of us usually take it for granted. If the client is trying to grow-out his or her hair the objective shifts and the hair is carefully trimmed so that the ends are even our hairs grow independently at varying rates of growth. Also sometimes hair textures are looser when wet and tighter when dry.
