<p>So while cutting your hair wont make it grow faster it will ensure that the length you have is strong and beautiful rather than wispy and damaged.

Hair growth rate is unaffected by regular haircuts color or styling. In fact having damaged hair removed does not in any way alter anyones genetic growth cycle. Pin On Hair And Beauty.</p>
